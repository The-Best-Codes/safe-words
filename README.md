# Age-Appropriate Safe-Word Lists

This repository contains two lists of words that aim to be appropriate for children. These lists can be used in various contexts such as educational games, child-friendly applications, or other situations where it is important to ensure a safe and positive experience for children.

## Files

- `verified-words.txt`: Every entry has been personally reviewed and approved by a human.
- `safe-words.txt`: A larger second list that hasn't yet been verified. Most obvious bad words have been removed, but feel free to open an issue or a PR if you spot something that shouldn't be there.
